# kanban-board
A frontend based project using Vue 2 to demonstrate the usage of VueX to handle state management and the usage of router to link to specific tasks.

## Functionalities
- Create, update and removal of tasks.
- Tasks consists of multiple fields including file upload
- Multiple progression states(Pending, Processing and Completed)
- Tasks can be *dragged* to and from each progression state
- Filtering of tasks via keywords
- Filtering of tasks via time range
- Progress bar to show overall completion rate

## Pending Improvements
- Sorting within columns(completed - pending PR)
- Updating file attachments, however initial creation with attachments is fine

Thank you and I do hope to hear from you soon!
